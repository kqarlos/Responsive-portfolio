## Code Snippets

![Site](assets/images/portfolio-row-snippet.png)

This code snippet had an example of a row from the Bootstrap grid system used in the Portfolio page. The column &lt;div class="col-12 col-lg-6 col-xl-4 my-2"&gt; includes the Bootstrap styling necessary to make the project cards responsive to three different browser dimensions. Each project card takes 4 columns at xl size, then 6 columns at lg size and all 12 columns at smaller sizes.
